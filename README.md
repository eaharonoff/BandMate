## Synopsis

BandMate is a social networking concept designed to bring artists together. Find and connect with musicians based on genres, instruments and location of your choosing. 
BandMate's frontend is currently being built/refactored with Javascript, React.js and Redux. 

## Motivation

BandMate aims to make it easier to find local musicians to hire, network or jam! 

## Installation

Fork/clone the repo. Run 'npm start' in the command line and React.js takes care of the rest.

## API Reference

BandMate depends on the BandMate API (https://github.com/eaharonoff/BandMate-API) which serves as Bandmate's storage end-point. The API is built on Ruby and Rails.
